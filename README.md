# Medical-Debt-Default-Risk-Analysis
## **Executive Summary**

This report provides an in-depth analysis of U.S. healthcare debt at the county, state, and national levels from 2011 through 2023, examining key demographic and financial factors influencing healthcare debt. Utilizing multiple data sources, including the Urban Institute Credit Profile Board, the American Hospital Association's Annual Survey database, the CMS Provider File, and the American Community Survey, this study evaluates the impact of hospital market concentration, hospital closures and mergers, the uninsured population, the percentage of adults with disabilities, and average household income on medical debt. Key recommendations include expanding health insurance coverage, providing financial support for low-income households, promoting healthcare market competition to control service costs, and harmonizing regional policies to address disparities and improve equity in healthcare access.

## __Motivation__
Healthcare providers and financial institutions increasingly face challenges related to unpaid medical bills, which can impact both operational stability and patient financial well-being.   This study utilizes comprehensive data to identify the key factors contributing to medical debt, such as income levels, insurance coverage, and regional healthcare dynamics.

## __Problem Definition__: 
This study aims to analyze data at state, and county levels to identify the key financial and demographic factors that contribute to higher medical debt. Understanding these factors is essential for developing effective policies and strategies to reduce medical debt and ensure fair access to healthcare for all.

We will address the following:
Identify key patient demographics and financial factors associated with higher default risk.
Examine attributes like income level, insurance coverage, and bill amount to assess their impact on the likelihood of default.
Analyze the influence of patient payment history on the probability of default.
Investigate how past payment behaviors correlate with the likelihood of future payment issues.
